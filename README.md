MiniLingo is a child-friendly language-learning game designed to turn screen time into a meaningful educational experience. As children are exposed to screens at younger ages, MiniLingo focuses on using technology to support cognitive and language development rather than distract from it.

The app helps young learners build vocabulary through an engaging, gamified format that encourages active participation, repetition, and confidence. Currently available in French, MiniLingo is especially suited for Canadian children beginning to learn a second language in elementary school. By combining simple gameplay with educational value, MiniLingo allows parents and educators to feel confident that screen time is both safe and beneficial, while also serving as a useful classroom tool for practice and review.
